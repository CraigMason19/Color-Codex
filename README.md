### Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**<br/>
Easily generate a 2D grid of color swatches that can be referenced in various projects to maintain color consistency. For example, texture / color atlases for use in games, a colour pallete for art programs like Blender, etc.

- **Export Options**<br/>
Export your color maps as PNG files for use in other applications.

- **Color Code Access**<br/>
Quickly retrieve HEX codes and RGB values (in both the 0-255 and 0.0-1.0 ranges) for each color.

### Controls
- **Context Menus**<br/>
    - **Input Menu**: **`Left-click`** on a grid item to open a context menu that allows you to enter colors in various formats. If the input is invalid, it will highlight in red.  
    **Note**: The color picker uses the HTML **`<input type="color">`** element, which includes an eyedropper tool. This tool may not function in some browsers if the EyeDropper API is unsupported.
      
    - **Copy Menu**: **`Right-click`** or press **`CTRL + C`** over a grid item to open the copy menu. **`Left-click`** in the menu to copy the relevant data to the clipboard.

    - **Closing Menus**: Press **`ESC`** or **`Click`** outside the context menu to close it.
